## Codeforces Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) competitive programming platform. Each solution is implemented in **Python 3** and organized in a simple format for easy navigation.

### 📝 Repository Structure

Each file in this repository corresponds to a **single problem** from Codeforces and is named using the **problem ID** as provided on the website.

The structure is as follows:
```
.
├── README.md      # This file
├── <problem_id_1>.py   # Solution for problem with ID 'problem_id_1'
├── <problem_id_2>.py   # Solution for problem with ID 'problem_id_2'
└── ...
```

**Example**:
If a problem ID on Codeforces is `123A`, then the solution will be saved as:
```
123A.py
```
