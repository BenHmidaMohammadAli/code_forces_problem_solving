## Codeforces Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) competitive programming platform. Each solution is implemented in **Python 3** and organized in a simple format for easy navigation.

This repository is part of a personal challenge I created for myself, aiming to progress from zero to hero in competitive programming.
